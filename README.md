## Mission statement

This open source project is for Mathematica implementations of statistical and machine learning algorithms that can be used for data analysis, prediction, and recommendation systems.

## Organization

The algorithms implementations are given in Mathematica package files ("*.m"). Explanations or presentations about the algorithms are given in Mathematica notebook files ("*.nb").

Here are some fairly unique to the Mathematica landscape algorithms:
- mosaic plots;
- outlier identifiers;
- associative rules finding;
- prefix trees;
- quantile regression;
- Chernoff faces;
- non-negative matrix factorization;
- independent component analysis;
- a framework for linear vector space representations of document collections;
- an item-item recommender framework based on sparse linear algebra;
- a naive Bayesian classifiers generator;
- functional parsers.

The implemented algorithms are (usually) well documented. There are also fair amount of documents with related applications.

Some of the algorithms have counterparts implementations in R or other languages.
