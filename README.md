## Mission statement

This open source project is for Mathematica implementations of statistical and machine learning algorithms 
that can be used for data analysis, prediction, and recommendation systems.

## Organization

The algorithms implementations are given in Mathematica package files ("*.m"). Explanations or presentations about the algorithms are given in Mathematica notebook files ("*.nb").

Here are some fairly unique to the Mathematica landscape algorithms:
- [mosaic plots](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/?s=mosaicplot);
- outlier identifiers;
- associative rules finding;
- [prefix trees (tries)](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/tries-with-frequencies-for-data-mining/);
- [quantile regression](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/?s=quantile+regression);
- [Chernoff faces](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/making-chernoff-faces-for-data-visualization/);
- non-negative matrix factorization;
- [independent component analysis](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/independent-component-analysis-for-multidimensional-signals/);
- [receiver operating characteristic](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/blob/master/MarkdownDocuments/ROCFunctions-Example-Usage.md);
- [classifier ensembles](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/blob/master/MarkdownDocuments/ROC-for-Classifier-Ensembles-Bootstrapping-Damaging-and-Interpolation.md);
- a framework for linear vector space representations of document collections;
- an item-item recommender framework based on sparse linear algebra;
- a naive Bayesian classifiers generator;
- [functional parsers](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/natural-language-processing-with-functional-parsers/).

The implemented algorithms are (usually) well documented. There are also fair amount of documents with related applications.

Some of the algorithms have counterparts implementations in R or other languages.
