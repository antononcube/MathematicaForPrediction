    This package provides functions for creation and classification with ensembles of classifiers.
    An ensemble of classifiers is simply an Association that maps classifier IDs to classifier functions.

    Given a classifier ensemble we have the obvious option to classify a record by classifier voting.
    Each classifier returns a label, we tally the returned labels, the returned label of the ensemble is
    the label with the largest tally number.

    Since ClassifierFunction has the method "Probabilities" for a classifier ensemble we can also average
    the probabilities for each label, and return the label with the highest average probability.
    If a threshold is specified for a label, then we can pick that label as the classification result
    if its average probability is above the threshold.

    The functions in this package are especially useful when used together with functions of
    the package ROCFunctions.m. See:

      https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForPrediction/blob/master/ROCFunctions.m .


    Usage example
    =============

    ## Getting data

      data = ExampleData[{"MachineLearning", "Titanic"}, "TrainingData"];
      data = ((Flatten@*List) @@@ data)[[All, {1, 2, 3, -1}]];
      trainingData = DeleteCases[data, {___, _Missing, ___}];

      data = ExampleData[{"MachineLearning", "Titanic"}, "TestData"];
      data = ((Flatten@*List) @@@ data)[[All, {1, 2, 3, -1}]];
      testData = DeleteCases[data, {___, _Missing, ___}];

    ## Create a classifier ensemble

      aCLs = EnsembleClassify[Automatic, trainingData[[All, 1 ;; -2]] -> trainingData[[All, -1]]]


    ## Classify a record

       EnsembleClassify[aCLs, testData[[1, 1 ;; -2]]]
       (* "survived" *)

       EnsembleClassifyByThreshold[aCLs, testData[[1, 1 ;; -2]], "survived" -> 2, "Votes"]
       (* "survived" *)

       EnsembleClassifyByThreshold[aCLs, testData[[1, 1 ;; -2]], "survived" -> 0.2, "ProbabilitiesMean"]
       (* "survived" *)


    ## Classify a list of records using a thershold

    ### Return "survived" if it gets at least two votes

       EnsembleClassifyByThreshold[aCLs, testData[[1 ;; 12, 1 ;; -2]], "survived" -> 2, "Votes"]

       (* {"survived", "died", "survived", "survived", "died", "survived", \
           "survived", "survived", "died", "survived", "died", "survived"} *)


    ### Return "survived" if its average probability is at least 0.7

       EnsembleClassifyByThreshold[aCLs, testData[[1 ;; 12, 1 ;; -2]], "survived" -> 0.7, "ProbabilitiesMean"]

       (* {"survived", "died", "survived", "died", "died", \
           "survived", "died", "survived", "died", "survived", "died", \
           "survived"} *)


    ## Threshold classification with ROC

    rocRange = Range[0, 1, 0.1];
    aROCs =
      Table[(cres = EnsembleClassifyByThreshold[aCLs, testData[[All, 1 ;; -2]], "survived" -> i];
             ToROCAssociation[{"survived", "died"}, testData[[All, -1]], cres]),
            {i, rocRange}];

    ROCPlot[rocRange, aROCs]
