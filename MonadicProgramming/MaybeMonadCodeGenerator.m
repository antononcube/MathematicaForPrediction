    ## In brief

    The code of this package is mostly made for demonstration purposes.

    In order to generate the "standard" Maybe monad code use the command:

        GenerateMaybeMonadCode["Maybe", "FailureSymbol" -> None ]

    Illustrative special functions can be generated with :

        GenerateMaybeMonadSpeciaCode["Maybe", "FailureSymbol" -> None ]


    ## Monad laws

    ### Left identity

        MaybeUnit[a] ⟹ f

        (* f[a] *)

    ### Right identity

        Maybe[a] ⟹ MaybeUnit

        (* Maybe[a] *)

    ### Associativity

        Maybe[a] ⟹ (Maybe@f1[#1] &)) ⟹ (Maybe@f2[#1] &)

        (* Maybe[f2[f1[a]]] *)

        Maybe[a] ⟹ Function[{x}, Maybe[f1[x]] ⟹ (Maybe[f2[#]] &)]

        (* Maybe[f2[f1[a]]] *)

        %% == %

        (* True *)
