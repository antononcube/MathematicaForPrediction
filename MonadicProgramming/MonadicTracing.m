    ## Introduction

    The monadic implementations in this file (not a package yet) allow tracking of the pipeline execution
    of functions with other monads.

    The primary reason for developing package was he desire to have the ability to print a tabulated trace
    of code and comments using the usual monad pipeline notation. (I.e. without conversion to strings etc.)

    From that perspective the main function is `TraceMonadEchoGrid`.

    ## Example

    In this example we can see that pipeline functions of the Maybe monad are interleaved with comment strings.
    Producing the grid of functions and comments happens "naturally" with the monad function `TraceMonadEchoGrid`.

        data = RandomInteger[10, 15];

        TraceMonadUnit[MaybeUnit[data]] ⟹ "lift to monad" ⟹
          TraceMonadEchoContext ⟹
          MaybeFilter[# > 3 &] ⟹ "filter current value" ⟹
          MaybeEcho ⟹ "display current value" ⟹
          MaybeWhen[#[[3]] > 3 &,
          MaybeEchoFunction[Style[#, Red] &]] ⟹
          (Maybe[#/4] &) ⟹
          MaybeEcho ⟹ "display current value again" ⟹
          TraceMonadEchoGrid[Grid[#, Alignment -> Left] &];

    Note that :
      1) the tracing is initiated by just using `TraceMonadUnit`;
      2) pipeline functions (actual code) and comments are interleaved;
      3) putting a comment string after a pipeline function is optional.


    ## Longer motivational discussion

    While writing an article on monadic programming in Mathematica / WL I made a function
    that tabulates code and comments. (See the definition below.)

    Here is an example:

        code = "
          FoldList[(* reduction function *)
            Plus,(* function to apply repeatedly *)
            0,(* initial value *)
            {1,2,3,3,100}(* arguments in repeated computations *)]";
        GridOfCodeAndComments[ code, "GridFunction" -> (Panel@Grid[#, Alignment -> Left] &)]

    I have several problems with the implementation of `GridOfCodeAndComments`,
    the main one being that I have to give a string to the function instead of (commented) code.

    For example, I would like to be able to write the tabulate code directly to `GridOfCodeAndComments`:

        GridOfCodeAndComments[
         FoldList[(* reduction function *)
            Plus,(* function to apply repeatedly *)
            0,(* initial value *)
            {1, 2, 3, 3, 100}(* arguments in repeated computations *)],
         "GridFunction" -> (Panel@Grid[#, Alignment -> Left] &)]


    See [2] for a larger discussion on that problem.


    ### Definition of GridOfCodeAndComments

        ClearAll[GridOfCodeAndComments]

        Options[GridOfCodeAndComments] = {"GridFunction" -> (Grid[#, Alignment -> Left] &)};

        GridOfCodeAndComments[code_String, opts : OptionsPattern[]] :=
          Block[{grData, codeLines, commentLines, comPat, gridFunc},

           gridFunc = OptionValue["GridFunction"];
           If[TrueQ[gridFunc === Automatic], gridFunc = (Grid[#, Alignment -> Left] &)];

           (* Split the code into lines *)
           codeLines = StringSplit[code, "\n"];

           (* Split each line into a {code, comment} pair *)
           comPat = ("(*" ~~ (Except["*"] ..) ~~ "*)");
           grData =
            Map[
             If[StringFreeQ[#, "("~~"*"], {#, ""},
               StringCases[#, (x__ ~~ y : (comPat) ~~ z___) :> {x <> z, y}][[1]]
             ] &, codeLines];

           (* Style the code and comments *)
           grData[[All, 1]] = Map[Style[#, "Input"] &, grData[[All, 1]]];
           grData[[All, 2]] =
           Map[Style[#, "CommentStyle" /. Options[$FrontEnd, AutoStyleOptions][[1, 2]]] &, grData[[All, 2]]];

           (* Show result *)
           gridFunc[grData]

          ];

    The problem gets simplified if we want to build code-comment grids for monad pipelines only.
    The resulting `TraceMonad` code is fairly simple, and demonstrates well the "programming semicolon"
    view of the binding operator in monadic programming.


    ## Monad code design and steps outline

    Generate a State monad code for the name `TraceMonad`.

    The `TraceMonad` has a context with keys "binder", "data", "commands", "comments".
    The values of "commands" and "comments" are incremented with new commands and comments
    given in the pipeline. Each command has a corresponding comment. (Empty comments are appended if needed.)

    Here are the steps for tracing a pipeline of a monad, e.g.

          Maybe[data] ⟹ MaybeEchoValue ⟹ (Maybe[#/2]&)

    1) `TraceMonadUnit`, monad's unit operator takes another monad object. E.g.

         TraceMonad[Maybe[data]] ⟹ MaybeEchoValue ⟹ (Maybe[#/2]&)

    2) The content of `TraceMonad[__]` is stored in the context for the key "data".

    3) If a call to `TraceMonadBind` is with a pipeline "function" that is a string,
       then append that string to the "comments" value in the context.

    4) If the pipeline function -- converted to a string -- matches `"TraceMonad"~~__`
       then handle as a `TraceMonad` pipeline function.

    5) Otherwise
    5.1. Call the wrapped monad binding operation with the function.
    5.2. Check is the result a failure.
    5.2.1.  If "yes", dump the current values of the context.
    5.2.2.  If "no", append the function to a "commands" value in the context.

    6) A grid of pipeline functions and comments can be displayed with `TraceMonadEchoGrid`.

    7) If the result of the pipeline is assigned to a variable, say, `res`
       then the pipeline can be can be re-executed with:

          Fold[MaybeBind, ReleaseHold[res[[2]]["data"]], res[[2]]["commands"]]
